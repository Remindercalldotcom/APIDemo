# APIDemo
This uses our XML API to send reminders and get status back via text or call. Using the API is fairly easy. You can use the Webhook information for status updates as a better alternative to requesting message statuses one at a time.
 
The demo page lets you:
1. Retrieve your key using your Remindercall.com username/password.
2. Send a text.
3. Send a voice call.
4. Get the status of a text. 

The sample page is here: http://www.snapnotify.net/APIDemo/apidemo.php

More information along with the Request and Response information is here: https://secure.remindercall.com/developers/api/xml/

Request sample code and more information by calling the office at 888-858-6673 or Email us at support@remindercall.com.

Happy Testing!
